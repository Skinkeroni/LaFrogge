    <h2> <u>What We Do</u></h2>
    <p>As COVID19 sweeps across the globe, forcing people to stay inside away from friends or family, the need for companion- ship is greater than ever. That’s where La Frogge comes in. For all of those who feel lonely and trapped, in need of something to brighten up their day, La Frogge pairs them with an emotional support frog, a friend and ally to make their day better.</p>
    <p>All frogs from La Frogge are raised from tadpoles alongside humans to ensure that they are well adjusted and won't be scared of human contact, nowhere on Earth can guarantee frogs as friendly as those from La Frogge. We also carefully screen all customers to ensure our frogs go to kind and caring homes. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <h2> <u>More About Frog</u></h2>
    <p>If you'd like to learn more about what kind of frogs we offer to decide which would be best for you, a handy list of frog species is available <a href="https://reptile.guide/best-pet-frogs/">here</a>. We provide a habitat for all of our frogs, along with care instructions, but for a more general overview of what it means to care for a frog you can check out this <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/frogs-as-pets-1236811">short overview</a>. </p>
    <p>We at La Frogge also work to protect wild frogs across the globe. As such we donate 15% of our proceeds to <a href="https://savethefrogs.com/"> SAVE THE FROGS</a>, an organisation devoted to the protection of frogs and other amphibians around the world. When you adopt from La Frogge you can be sure that you are supporting sustainable practices, and helping ensure that frogs can live alongside (and help) mankind for many years to come. </p>
